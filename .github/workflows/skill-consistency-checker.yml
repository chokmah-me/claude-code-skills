            [OK] Skill consistency analysis completed!
            
            This workflow checks for consistency across all skills in the repository:
            - [NEW] Naming convention consistency
            - [DIR] File structure standardization
            - [TARGET] Quality scoring and validation
            - [LINK] Dependency analysis
            - [STATS] Cross-skill compatibility
            
            **Status**: ${{ job.status == 'success' && '[OK] CONSISTENT' || '[WARN]  INCONSISTENCIES FOUND' }}
            
            Check the [workflow logs](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }}) for detailed analysis.
            
            ### What was checked:
            - [OK] Naming conventions (kebab-case, snake_case, etc.)
            - [OK] Required file structure (SKILL.md, README.md, template.md)
            - [OK] Content quality and completeness
            - [OK] Skill dependencies and circular references
