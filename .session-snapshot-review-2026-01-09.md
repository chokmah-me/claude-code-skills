# Session Snapshot - Session-Snapshot Skill Review
**Date**: 2026-01-09
**Project**: claude-code-skills
**Working Directory**: `G:\My Drive\07_Code_Projects\claude-code-skills`
**Session ID**: magical-skipping-whisper

---

## 🎯 Session Goal
Review the session-snapshot skill in the claude-code-skills repository and create a plan for carefully fixing any identified issues.

---

## 📊 Current State

### Completed Work
1. ✅ Generated repository briefing for claude-code-skills
   - Hierarchical skills library with analysis/, development/, git/, and meta/ categories
   - Recent commits focus on Unicode/emoji fixes and automated inventory updates
   - No package.json found (pure documentation/skills repository)

2. ✅ Comprehensive exploration of session-snapshot skill completed
   - Located in `meta/session-snapshot/`
   - 3 files analyzed: SKILL.md (316 lines), README.md (419 lines), template.md (108 lines)
   - Full assessment completed by Explore agent (ac6d44a)

3. ✅ Identified 8 primary issues and 4 priority levels of fixes
   - **Critical**: Section header mismatch with validation framework
   - **Important**: Missing clarification on automation vs manual invocation
   - **Moderate**: Resume instructions complexity, documentation gaps

### Current Status
- **Mode**: Plan Mode (active, no execution yet)
- **Phase**: Initial Understanding complete, moving to user request
- **Next**: User wants to save this snapshot and work on something else

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Session-Snapshot Skill Assessment

**Overall Quality Score**: 8.5/10
**Status**: Production-ready with minor documentation restructuring needed
**Validation**: PASSES core requirements but has structural format mismatches

#### Strengths
- Excellent content quality and comprehensive documentation
- Multi-layer resume architecture (quick/cold/failure scenarios)
- Token-efficient design (~1500 tokens vs 10K+ for full restart = 93-96% savings)
- Markdown-based portability
- Well-integrated with other skills (skill-extractor, diff-summariser, lean-plan)

#### Issues Identified

**Priority 1 - Validation Compliance** (CRITICAL):
- SKILL.md uses plain headers (`## Purpose`) instead of emoji headers (`## 🎯 Purpose`)
- Missing `## 🚀 Key Features` section
- Missing `## 🎛️ Parameters` section (should note "no parameters")
- Missing `## 🎁 Output` section (outputs scattered in examples)
- Has `## Instructions` instead of expected `## 📋 Usage`

**Priority 2 - Functionality Clarification**:
- Ambiguous about when Claude auto-triggers vs manual user invocation
- No timing guidance for snapshot suggestions
- Missing documentation on snapshot size limits/performance

**Priority 3 - Enhanced Documentation**:
- No Windows-specific .gitignore handling
- Missing snapshot archival/retention policy guidance
- Resume instructions complex and potentially intimidating
- Common failure scenarios not documented

**Priority 4 - Optional Enhancements**:
- Token cost claims not empirically validated
- No snapshot comparison/diff functionality
- Missing multi-team management templates

## 🎯 Decisions Made

1. **Analysis Approach**: Used single Explore agent (efficient for focused review)
2. **Assessment Framework**: Evaluated against validation requirements and best practices
3. **Issue Prioritization**: Categorized into 4 priority levels based on impact
4. **No execution yet**: Plan mode active, no edits made

---

## 💭 Open Questions & Blockers

### Questions for Future Work
1. Should validation framework be updated to accept alternate section headers, OR should all skills conform to emoji format?
2. What's the exact validation script logic? (need to read validate_skills.py)
3. Should session-snapshot skill have configurable parameters added (e.g., detail level, sections to include)?
4. How to empirically measure token costs for validation?

### No Current Blockers
All analysis complete, ready for implementation when user authorizes.

## 📝 Notes & Context

### User Intent
- User requested: "review the session snapshot and plan on fixing carefully"
- Entered plan mode for systematic review
- After comprehensive analysis, user asked to "save this snapshot we'll be doing something else"

### Important Context
- This is a **meta skill reviewing another meta skill** - session-snapshot is used to save sessions, and we're now saving a snapshot of reviewing it (recursive use case!)
- The repository has automated workflows that update skill inventories
- Recent focus on Unicode/emoji fixes across repository
- Validation framework enforces consistent structure

### Technical Notes
- Repository has no package.json (pure documentation/skills)
- Git branch: master (no main branch configured)
- Working directory on Windows (G:\My Drive\...)
- Claude Code version: Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

## 🚀 Resume Instructions

### To Resume This Session (Quick - Same Session)
If you're resuming in the same conversation:
1. Say: "Continue with session-snapshot review"
2. I'll proceed from "user wants to save and switch tasks"
3. Plan file location: `C:\Users\danie\.claude\plans\magical-skipping-whisper.md`

### To Resume This Session (Cold - New Session)
If starting a new conversation:
1. Read this snapshot file: `.session-snapshot-review-2026-01-09.md`
2. Read the comprehensive analysis in this snapshot
3. Say: "I've reviewed the session snapshot. The session-snapshot skill has been fully analyzed with 8 issues identified across 4 priority levels. Ready to proceed with fixes when authorized."
4. Ask user which priority level of fixes to implement

### If Implementation Started and Failed
1. Run: `git status` to see what was changed
2. Run: `git diff` to review uncommitted changes
3. Check if SKILL.md was edited (should be only file modified)
4. If needed: `git restore meta/session-snapshot/SKILL.md` to revert
5. Re-read this snapshot
6. Start fresh with Priority 1 fixes only

---

## 🔧 Next Steps (When Resuming)

### Immediate Next Actions
1. User will specify new task to work on
2. This snapshot preserved for later resumption
3. If returning to session-snapshot fixes:
   - Start with Priority 1 (validation compliance)
   - Update SKILL.md section headers
   - Add missing required sections
   - Test against validation framework

### Future Considerations
- May need to read validation script to understand exact requirements
- Should test emoji rendering in different markdown viewers
- Consider consistency across all meta/ skills
- Document the fix process as potential new skill workflow

**Snapshot Status**: ✅ Complete
**Ready for Context Switch**: Yes
**Return Path**: Clear and documented above
