# Session Snapshot

**Timestamp**: [YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ]
**Task**: [One-line summary of overall goal]
**Phase**: [Current specific step in progress]

## Context

[2-4 sentences explaining what we're doing and why. Include relevant background from CLAUDE.md or project docs if applicable.]

## Decisions Made

- [Key architectural or implementation decision 1 with brief rationale]
- [Key architectural or implementation decision 2 with brief rationale]
- [Any important choices that future sessions need to remember]

## Files Modified

- `path/to/file.ext` (lines X-Y: what changed and why)
- `path/to/new_file.ext` (new file: purpose)
- `path/to/another.ext` (lines A-B: specific modification)

## Files Read (Context)

- `path/to/context_file.ext` (why this was relevant)
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (understanding system design)
- `path/to/related.ext` (checking interface compatibility)

## Current State

**Test status**: [✅ All passing | ⚠️ N failing | ❌ Not run | 🔄 Running]
**Git status**: [Clean | Uncommitted changes | Staged changes]
**Commit SHA**: [abc123def] (baseline before modifications, if applicable)
**Build status**: [✅ Success | ⚠️ Warnings | ❌ Failed | - Not run]

## Next Steps

- [ ] [Immediate next action with file:line reference if applicable]
- [ ] [Second step]
- [ ] [Third step]
- [ ] [Fourth step - testing/validation]
- [ ] [Final step - commit/documentation]

## Blockers

[If no blockers: "None currently"]

- **[Issue 1 title]**: [Description and potential solution approach]
- **[Issue 2 title]**: [Description and potential solution approach]

## Resume Instructions

### Quick Resume (if context still loaded)
```
Continue with next step: [First uncompleted todo from Next Steps]
```

### Cold Resume (new session or after context clear)
```
1. Read this file (.session-snapshot.md)
2. Read modified files to understand current changes:
   - [file 1]
   - [file 2]
3. Read context files for background:
   - [file 1]
   - [file 2]
4. Verify current state:
   - Run tests: [test command]
   - Check git: git status
5. Continue from "Next Steps" checklist item [N]
```

### Recovery from Failure
```
If changes broke something or you need to restart:

1. Check current state:
   - git status (see what's modified)
   - git diff [commit_sha] (compare to snapshot baseline)

2. Review approach:
   - Read "Decisions Made" section
   - Check "Blockers" for known issues

3. Recovery options:
   - Option A: Fix forward from current state
   - Option B: Reset to baseline: git reset --hard [commit_sha]
     ⚠️ WARNING: Option B loses all uncommitted changes
   - Option C: Stash and retry: git stash && [restart from step 1]

4. If approach was flawed:
   - Review alternative approaches
   - Ask user for guidance
   - Consider different architectural decision
```

### If Snapshot is Stale
```
If project state has diverged significantly since snapshot:

1. Create new snapshot to capture current state
2. Archive this snapshot: mv .session-snapshot.md .session-snapshot-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
3. Use new snapshot as baseline
```
